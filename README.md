This is a command line application that works similar to NYT's Wordle. 

Just open a terminal and run the 'main.py' file. All of the instructions are given to you. Try to guess the word!

MORE INFORMATION, FOR THOSE INTERESTED:

The 'words.txt' file is the file which is used to grab all of the five letter words, and export them to the 'five_letter_words.txt' file. 

It was quite difficult to find a comprehensive list of all english words that are actually words. I used the best list that I could find, but I am, admittedly, still not very happy with it. I am brainstorming a solution to this. 

The UI is coming. Soon, hopefully, you won't have to worry about the command line, and it will run in the browser. 

Thanks for reading! Stay tuned!
